# Monkey-AGI
A minimal reinforcement-learning agent that learns to choose between two identical taps: one contains sugar water (reward = +5) and the other plain water (reward = 0). The agent has no built-in rules and learns purely from trial and error using an Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) neural network.
